#### Research Scientist, Collaboration with DILL Lab	

- Investigated covert dialect bias in LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini, LLaMA, DeepSeek) by comparing model responses to African American Vernacular English (AAVE) vs. Standard American English (SAE) prompts, using both direct and indirect trait attribution analyses.
- Built a full NLP evaluation pipeline with Hugging Face Transformers, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, incorporating preprocessing, structured prompting, score extraction, and data visualization to quantify dialect-related disparities.
- Implemented counterfactual fairness finetuning on Gemini and LLaMA-3 using LoRA-based hyperparameter tuning, significantly reducing dialect disparities.
