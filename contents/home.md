I am a graduate student in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, driven by a commitment to building safe, ethical, and socially responsible AI systems. My academic and research background bridges technical expertise in machine learning and natural language processing with a strong focus on AI safety, alignment, and governance. I am particularly interested in the development of regulatory frameworks for foundation models, the societal impact of recommendation systems on vulnerable communities, and the design of effective methods and policies to evaluate and mitigate bias in AI systems.
